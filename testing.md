# Manual Testing---
My manual testing can be categorized in 3 sections. I have being testing throughout whenever I added a new section 
with [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) , the problems which I found have been logged throughout 
in my commits. Secondly when I deployed my page on GitHub Pages I sent it on to friends and family to try it out, they pointed out 1 or 2 grammatical errors,
and also when I tested on JSHint I had to declare variables. However when I declared them without attributing a value it caused a bug 
which caused every difficulty to have the same time, this was pointed out by a friends 6 year old son, So I declared the variables with the 
approriate values. 
Lastly I tested the site for the user stories and goals which I stated earlier and to check if the website works and behaves like it should.

## Testing User Goals 
* Finding out how to play the game. I opened up the site and pressed the "how to play" button, this brought up a modal which explained 
how to launch the game and how to play it, closing this brought us back to the main window. Passed all tests.[Screenshots]()
